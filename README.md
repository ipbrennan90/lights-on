# Lights Out
### Get Started
  - npm install
- to run tests: npm run test

  - webpack-dev-server
	- may take a few seconds for the board image to load, the image loader is a bit slow
	- if dev server won't run you may need to install webpack-dev-server globally
	- npm install webpack-dev-server -g

### Recommendations
  - Although it is fun to see, setting width and height to anything over 100 may break it
  - plus, I'm guessing you're pretty smart but a puzzle anywhere near 100x100 might take you a while
