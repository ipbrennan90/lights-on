# Lights Out
### Get Started
  - npm install
  - webpack-dev-server
	- to run tests: npm run test

### Recommendations
  - Although it is fun to see, setting width and height to anything over 100 may break it
  - plus, I'm guessing you're pretty smart but a puzzle anywhere near 100x100 might take you a while
